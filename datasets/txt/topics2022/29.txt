A 57-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to constipation.  His last bowel movement was 2 days ago. He complains of spending about 30 minutes once attempting to defecate. He also has lower back pain.  There is no history of trauma. The pain is not relieved with over-the-counter pain medications.  His vital signs are within normal limits.  Examination shows low back pain that is worse with back flexion and raising of the legs; it radiates into his left leg.  Pinprick in the perianal area does not cause rapid contraction of the anal sphincter.  The rest of the neurologic examination is normal. He is suspected of Cauda Equina syndrome and referred to a spinal MRI.
