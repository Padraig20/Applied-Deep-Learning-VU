A 23-year-old female has prolonged oral bleeding immediately after a tooth extraction.  Despite several interventions, the bleeding persists for hours and stops only after desmopressin (DDAVP) administration.  The patient has heavy menstrual cycles each month.  She has no other medical problems and takes no medications.  Her mother and grandmother have also had excessive bleeding during menstrual period.  Review of systems is positive for mild bruising on his legs. Laboratory findings reveal a normal platelet count and an abnormal ristocetin cofactor assay, as well as CB <= 0.30 IU/mL and FVIII:C <= 0.40 IU/mL.
