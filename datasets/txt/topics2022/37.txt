A 47-year-old man comes to the office due to weight gain and fatigue.  He is not able to lift heavy objects or climb stairs. Family history is positive for DM type 2 and HTN in his father.  Blood pressure is 165/90 mm Hg and pulse is 85/min.  On physical examination, there is symmetric proximal muscle weakness of the upper and lower extremities.  Fasting plasma glucose level is 138 mg/dL and 24-hour urinary cortisol is twice the upper normal limit.  Further evaluation reveals that high-dose, but not low-dose, dexamethasone suppresses serum cortisol levels.  Serum ACTH levels are high-normal. This patient's findings are consistent with endogenous Cushing Syndrome.
