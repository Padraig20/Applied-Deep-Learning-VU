A 32-year-old woman comes to the hospital with vaginal spotting.  Her last menstrual period was 10 weeks ago. She has regular menses lasting for 6 days and repeating every 29 days. Medical history is significant for appendectomy and several complicated UTIs. She has multiple male partners, and she is inconsistent with using barrier contraceptives. Vital signs are normal.  Serum Î²-hCG level is 1800 mIU/mL, and a repeat level after 2 days shows an abnormal rise to 2100 mIU/mL.  Pelvic ultrasound reveals a thin endometrium with no gestational sac in the uterus.
