A 60-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of hand tremor that started few months ago.  It is most bothering when he wants to drink from a glass or pour from a bottle. He does not smoke, but drinks occasionally. He recently started consuming more alcohol as his tremor subsides somewhat when he drinks small amounts of alcohol.  Family history is significant for similar problems in his mother.  Vital signs are normal and the patient has no other medical conditions.  Neurologic examination shows bilateral tremor in the upper extremities. The diagnosis of essential tremor is confirmed.
