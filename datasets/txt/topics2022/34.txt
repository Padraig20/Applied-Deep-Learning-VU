A 17-year-old male comes to the office due to several months of right elbow pain.  The pain is worse with activity and limits his workouts and activities.  He has tried over-the-counter medications with limited relief.  Medical history is notable for eczema, and current medications include a topical hydrocortisone ointment.  He is sexually active with his girlfriend and uses condoms. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He plays tennis most of the days of the week. The comprehensive evaluation shows pain on the lateral side of the elbow, made worse by pressure applied on the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and when making a fist with the elbow joint straightened. The patient has this pain since last year and had several courses of physical therapy.
