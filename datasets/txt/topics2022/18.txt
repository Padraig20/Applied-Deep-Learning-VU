A 2-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents due to a rash that started 1 week ago.  A similar red, itchy rash on the cheeks, trunk, and arms has occurred intermittently since infancy.  The patient has had a few upper respiratory infections but no major illnesses.  Vaccinations are up to date, and he takes no medications. He is on a balanced diet, and he is healthy in appearance.  Vital signs and milestone examination are within normal limits.  Similar findings are observed on the cheeks and proximal upper extremities.  The diaper area is clear, and no mucosal lesions are present.
