A 50-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of difficulty swallowing both liquids and solid foods, as well as occasional cough while eating.  She also has difficulty lifting her arms above her head and getting up from a chair. The weakness seems to get worse gradually. The patient has no prior medical problems and takes no medications.  Vital signs are normal.  Physical examination shows an erythematous rash on the upper eyelids. There are some red papules over joints of her hands. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-Jo-1 antibodies and anti-MDA5 antibody are positive.  Muscle biopsy shows perifascicular inflammation and atrophy of the fascicle and surrounding blood vessels.
