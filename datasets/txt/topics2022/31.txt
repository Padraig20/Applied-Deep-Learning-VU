A 25-year-old woman comes to the clinic with her roommate.  The roommate says that the patient has twice fallen asleep while they were talking.  The patient has regularly fallen asleep in the afternoon while reading or watching television but typically feels refreshed after a brief nap.  She also reveals that she sometimes hears a voice prior to falling asleep.  She also complains of some episodes of clumsiness that cause her to drop objects or fall. MSLT showed that the sleep latency was less than 8 min and that the patient enters rapid eye movement (REM) sleep almost immediately.
