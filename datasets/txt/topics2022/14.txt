A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe left toe pain.  The toe is red and exhibits swelling. The patient is not febrile, and does not remember any recent trauma. Medical history is not significant except for the similar attacks and the diagnosis of gouty arthritis. His medication history includes Allopurinol to prevent gouty attacks. His father has the same medical condition. However, his older brother who is 41 years old is healthy with no history of gouty arthritis. Physical examination shows a swollen, tender first metatarsophalangeal joint.  Aspiration of the joint showed high leukocyte count, negative Gram stain, and numerous needle-shaped crystals, which is compatible with gouty arthritis.
