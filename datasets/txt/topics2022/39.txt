A 55-year-old white woman comes for a routine checkup.  She has no significant medical history and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs.  The patient's only medication is an over-the-counter multivitamin.  Family history is notable for a hip fracture in her mother.  Blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg and pulse is 112/min. She has occasional back pain and lives a sedentary lifestyle with the BMI of 24 Kg/m2. Plain X-ray of the spine shows mild compression fracture at the level of T10. X-ray absorptiometry studies demonstrate abnormally low bone density in the lumbar vertebrae and T-score values below -2.5, which confirms the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
