A 3-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her parents for assessment of her short stature. Physical examination reveals short limbs and a relatively large head. She has a flat nasal bridge and a small midface. The girl's father exhibits similar physical features; however, her mother looks normal. The genetic testing reveals an autosomal dominant point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene consistent with achondroplasia in both father and the child. The girl has not received any treatment yet, and it is her first visit after immigration to the US. The other mental and developmental examinations are unremarkable.
