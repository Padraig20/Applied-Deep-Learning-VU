The patient is a 79 yoF w/ a h/o CAD s/p RCA stenting, diastolic CHF, 1+ MR, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, previous smoking history, and atrial fibrillation who presents for direct admission from home for progressive shortness of breath. According to Pt, her primary complaint is not shortness of breath, but cough X 1 week which has been rarely productive of white sputum. She denies associated fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, pleuritic pain, weight gain, or dietary indiscretion. She also reports a sore throat over the past 3 days. She recently underwent thoracentesis for a moderate size pleueral effusion.  Cytology of the effusion was negative for malignant cells. Pt denies recent palpitations, and reports that she has been compliant with all medications. She admits to recent fatigue and 2 pillow orthopnea which has been present for months.  Current etiology considerations include CHF vs intrinsic pulmonary disease (infiltrative) vs embolic disease.  In order to optimize cardic function with atrial kick, pt underwent cardioversion and became hypotensive with a junctional rhythm requiring intubation.  She was placed on dobutamine.  Off of dobutamine, cardiac monitoring demonstrated a long QTc of 700 and an atrial escape rhythm.
