A 90+ year old woman who was recently hospitalized for legionella PNA, and has been continuing her recovery at home with her son.  She had been doing fairly well for the last few days except for some waxing and waning confusion, and perhaps intermittent dysarthria.  The son was getting ready for work at 1:15am today, as per his usual routine.  He looked in on the patient at that time; she appeared to be sleeping comfortably in bed, on her back.  Soon thereafter, he heard her walking to the bathroom. At 1:40am, he heard a loud crash coming from the bathroom.  He found the patient on the floor of the bathroom, making non-verbal utterances and with minimal movement of the right side.
