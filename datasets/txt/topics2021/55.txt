A 22-year-old Caucasian man came to the Clinic with a history of tremors since a year ago. The tremor was first in his right hand while holding something. Later the tremor became continuous and extended to both hands and legs and even at rest. The Kayser-Fleischer' ring was detected in the ophthalmologic exam. The physical exam revealed jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and hypotonia of the upper limbs. He had a constant smile on his face, however, he has aggressive behavior according to his parents' explanation. His laboratory study was significant for a low serum caeruloplasmin (0.05 g/l), and a raised 24 hour urine copper excretion (120 μg/24 h). Wilson disease was confirmed by high liver copper concentration (305 μg/g dry weight of liver).
