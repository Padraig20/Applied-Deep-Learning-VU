This is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation. He presented with his disease back in [**10/2119**] with an elevated white count and LDH. He was without any splenomegaly or any cytopenias at that time. He did have some bulky lymphadenopathy. He then completed four cycles of FCR therapy, which he completed back in 09/[**2119**]. He had an excellent response to therapy and was monitored off treatment for approximately two years. He then presented in [**7-/2122**] with a rising white count, approximately 50% lymphocytes, and a mildly elevated LDH. He also had some mild worsening palpable lymphadenopathy. He then received four cycles of PCR, but did not have much in the way of response and his treatment regimen was switched to R-CVP of which he received two cycles. He did again not have a significant response, though continued to have an excellent performance status, and he was ultimately switched to Campath therapy. He did have resolution of his lymphocytosis, and his white count has come down nicely, but did not have much in the way of response in terms of reducing his bulky lymphadenopathy. He then eventually had developed an enlarging left cervical node which was biopsied and was found to have Richter's transformation.
