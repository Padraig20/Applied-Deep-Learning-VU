This is a 78 year-old male with h/o BPH s/p multiple urological procedures, including s/p Suprapubic prostatectomy. He was noted to have low urine output and bladder scan showed 360cc residual. It was impossible for staff to pass a foley. Urology was consulted, performed a flexible cystoscopy in the ICU and found severe 2cm bulbar urethral stricture. They were able to pass small catheter through and left in place. The patient leaked around the catheter, the catheter eventually came out but he continued to have good urine output and post-void bladder scans were performed q4h to ensure he did not have high residual volume. Urology suggested that when patient is stable he will have to be taken to the OR to have the stricture surgically fixed.
