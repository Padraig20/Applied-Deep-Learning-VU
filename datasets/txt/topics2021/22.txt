The patient is a 31-year-old woman complaining of abdominal pain. The pain started last night as diffuse abdominal discomfort. She had poor appetite as well as malaise. The pain worsened in intensity and became sharp in the morning. The pain became localized to the right lower quadrant in the morning. The temperature is within the normal limits with normal vital signs. Focal tenderness and guarding were observed during palpation of the right lower quadrant. Palpation of the left lower quadrant causes pain on the right. Her lab work is remarkable for leukocytosis.
Computed Tomography of the abdomen with contrast shows the presence of a distended appendix with thickened appendiceal wall without perforation, abscess or gangrene.
