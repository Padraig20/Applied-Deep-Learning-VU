60 yo M with Hep C cirrhosis, grade II esophageal varices, recent admission for UGIB [**2-9**] NSAID gastritis, referred for admission throught the ED by hepatology clinic for new slurred speech and tangential thought process. Patient also describes new imbalance leading to a fall during which he may have hit his head on. Per last liver clinic note has been off ETOH for a year (corroborated with pt), utox was negative for alocohol. CT was within normal limits, and neuro evaluation determined this was not ischemic infart. Patient was given a presumptive diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and started on lactulose. Liver function tests showed a striking increase in his total and direct bilirubin since last visit. Another worrisome feature was the increase in the patient's AFP. This could be progression of cirrhosis as he failed interferon twice. He is to follow-up as an outpatient to work this up.
