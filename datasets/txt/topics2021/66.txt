A 16-year-old girl came to the clinic complaining of weight gain and abnormal menstrual cycles. Her BMI was 24, but she has gained 5 kg in the past few weeks. She gets tired more frequently and does not have energy to go dancing with her friends. Her lab results were remarkable for high TSH levels (15 mU/L) and low free T4 levels (0.18 ng/dl). Her anti-TPO levels were extremely high (136 IU/ml). She was diagnosed with Hashimoto disease. She does not smoke and she is not sexually active.
