The patient is a 17-year-old boy complaining of severe migratory pain in the right lower quadrant of his abdomen that started four days ago. The pain is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He was febrile with tenderness, rebound tenderness and guarding on palpation. His WBC was elevated with dominant neutrophils. CT scan showed evidence of acute perforated appendicitis with free fluid in the pelvis. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed phlegmon with no other abdominal abnormalities. He is now a candidate for emergent laparoscopic appendectomy under general anesthesia.
