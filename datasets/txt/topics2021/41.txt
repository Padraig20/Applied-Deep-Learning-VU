His past medical history is significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He lives with his wife. They have three children. He used to be active with planting and taking care of their farm animals before his diagnosis. The patient complains of shaking and slow movement. He had difficulty entering through a door, as he was frozen and needed guidance to step in. His handwriting is getting smaller. He is on Levodopa and Trihexyphenidyl. He stated his medications help with shaking and slow movement. But he still has difficulty initiating movements, stiffness and slowness in general.
