41 year old man with history of severe intellectual disability, CHF, epilepsy presenting with facial twitching on the right and generalized shaking in at his NH which required 20 mg valium to cease seizure activity. Per outside medical patient was felt to have focal epilepsy with secondary generalization, likely due to anoxic brain injury at birth, and probably related to the atrophic changes seen on MRI, particularly in the left temporal lobe.
The patient first developed seizures at age 13 found by family to have a generalized convulsion. He had a second seizure two years after his first episode. He was maintained on Dilantin and phenobarbital. The patient went 20 years without another seizure. He was recently tapered off Dilantin, and it was felt that perhaps this medication was necessary to maintain him seizure free. The patient had no further events during the hospital course and was back at his baseline at the time of discharge. Full EEG reports are pending at the time of dictation.
