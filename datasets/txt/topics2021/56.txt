The patient is a 41-year-old man and a known case of Acromegaly who underwent transsphenoidal surgery 4 months ago. He came to the clinic for the follow up lab studies after his primary resection surgery. His lab study shows the IGF-1 level of 4.5 ULN adjusted by sex and age. His random GH level is 4 ug/L. The recent brain MRI confirmed the residual pituitary tumor. His past medical history is only significant for acromegaly due to pituitary adenoma and the recent surgery. After his surgery he takes only vitamin D and multivitamins.
